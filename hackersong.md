# I AM A HACKER
## a Single by  R E D A C T E D

Growing up, I watched Mission Impossible

Tom Cruise became my Mr. Possible

He hacked the system,

He dodged the law,

He flew helicopters,

And guess what?

Now I’m on the run, in the digital deep,

My Greek Goddess in the clutches of 'em Romans

Cracked the code, now secrets ain't cheap.

Unce unce unce (beat beat beat)

I am a hackaaa,

I am a supa hackaaa—

But now the Claudius II Syndicate...

(Transmission Lost…)
